Current Position:
Current UOB MSc Student. I love everything about software and programming. My goal is to become a highly valuable full-stack software engineer.

University of Bristol
Oct 2020 to Oct 2021: MSc Computer Science Conversion.
Learned fundamentals of computer architecture, from boolean algebra to logic gates to devices and drivers and RISC Architecture. Focused on Arm Assembly as the core low level-langue in the module, taught me about register and stack operations, binary arithmetic, types of memory, memory management, fetch execute cycle, stack, and frame pointers, how recursive functions work on the metal, conditional statements using CSPR flags.
Became a proficient C programmer. Learned about pointers, memory allocation with malloc and calloc, reading in files, concurrent programming, and piping and recursion. Built data structures and algorithms from scratch, using C structures. For example, Linked lists, Graphs, recursive Trees, dynamic Arrays, Hash Tables/Associative Arrays (Cuckoo, Linked List). For my final project, I built a descendant recursive parser and interpreter. The formal grammar was based on Logo/turtle. The interpreter used SDL to draw the commands to the screen.
Became proficient Java programmer. Become fluent with the OOP paradigm and design practices - abstracting and modeling data using classes that are based on the principles of Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction. Built an SQL database from scratch. Made a simple BNF for the language, and created an SQL parser/interpreter. I used JavaIO to read and write the data from the queries to a directory that stored the data in text files. Also, built a text-based adventure game engine, that creates a game from the specifications in dot and JSON files. Github Links: "https://github.com/Huz1995/JavaSQL_Server_Database-from-ground-0-"
Lead a software development team in university to build a product that allows users to map their opinions on a globe universal to all users. Users can search keywords and then pins relating to that keyword will pop up on the globe. The globe will also display the trend of emotions of the users across the globe. Technologies used are Angular, NodeJs, Express and MongoDb. Have used HTML, TypeScript, CSS. Github Link: "https://github.com/Huz1995/EmoteMap"
I am building a complex flutter application for my dissertation. Unable to discuss at the minute.

Stuck in India Feb 2020 - Sept 2020:

I left my accounting job as I wasn’t passionate about the career and decided to visit my brother in India. Whilst there, Air India canceled my flight and wasn’t able to come home until September 2020.
In that time I became interested in Machine Learning. I studied the basics like linear and logistic regression. I then learned about the architecture of neural networks and took Andrew Ng’s Deeplearning course. It gave me an appreciation of how frameworks like PyTorch work under the hood. I also did courses in Python. The completion certificates can be seen on my LinkedIn
I also was interested in software development so I have taken ACEMIND Academy’s Flutter/ Angular Courses and Angela Yu’s Full Stack Web Development Course. This came in handy at university where I will be applying this knowledge-building software.
